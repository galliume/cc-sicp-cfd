### Project: High-Performance Computational Fluid Dynamics Engine

*Designed and implemented a parallelized Navier-Stokes solver from first principles.*

* **Architecture:** Applied functional programming paradigms (SICP) to decouple physics solvers from memory management, improving code modularity.

* **Performance:** Optimized mesh data structures for cache locality, implementing custom linear solvers (TDMA, Gauss-Seidel).

* **Theory:** Implemented algorithmic optimizations (Logarithmic recursion, Stream processing) derived from rigorous study of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.
